# Concepts

- Processes and tools for managing versions/revisions
- CM->SCM
- VCS->DVCS

### [Configuration Management (CM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management)

- Practice of handling changes systematically so that a system maintains its integrity over time.
 - Policies, procedures, techniques, and tools
 - Manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes
 - Maintain Inventory of system and support documents as the system changes

### [Software CM (SCM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management)

- CM applied to software
- Track and controll changes in the software
- Revision Control and the establishment of baselines

---

### Centralized VCS

- Everyone stores history on a central repository
- Only the central repo gets a full copy of the history

- [Version Control System (VCS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_Control_System)
 - Tracks and provides control over changes to source code
 - Versions/Revisions: Baseline, Branch, Tag, etc
 - Single authoritative data store
 - (Client/Server)

### Distributed Version Control

- Team members send changes to each other
- Everyone can work offline

- [Distributed VCS (DVCS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control_system)
 - Each working copy functions as fully functional backup
 - Peer-To-Peer
